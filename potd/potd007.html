  exolve-prelude: 
    <b>Instructions:</b> The solutions to seven clues need to be turned into different (unclued) words before they will fit into the grid. Each of those seven clues contains a superfluous word that is itself a clue to an unmodified solution elsewhere in the grid, and in the clue for that unmodified solution there can be seen a hint to what needs to be changed. Letter counts in all clues are for the words to be entered.
