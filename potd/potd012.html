  exolve-prelude: 
    <b>Introduction</b><br>In this crossword, every clue-and-answer pair includes some connection to baseball, with a focus whenever possible on the Minnesota Twins. As such, there is a touch of obfuscation in a small number of clues, which omit capitalization in regards to team names, surnames, or nicknames.<br><br>The clues to the three highlighted answers (the Ninas) include no definition, but contain an extra word... or several. Combining the parts of those clues which are not involved in their wordplay creates the clue which those three solutions, combined, answer.
