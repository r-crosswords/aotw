  exolve-prelude:
  Each solution begins with the letter given by the clue. Enter them in the placeholders provided.<br>
    Once you have sufficient solutions you may work out where they fit, jigsaw-wise, in the grid and so begin entering them. To assist with this, select a light in the grid then click on the button next to the appropriate solution to insert it.<br>
    <b>Note:</b> <i>There is only one way to fit the solutions into the grid, but it is possible to go a long way down the wrong path before it becomes impossible.</i><br>&#160;<br><br>'Reveal' and 'Check' operations (for correct entries) will also reveal clue parsing notes. Definitions get <span class="xlv-definition">underlined</span> within the clues.
