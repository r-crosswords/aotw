  exolve-title: "Hexed Again!"
  exolve-setter: Level 51
  exolve-prelude: 
    This grid was once a plain barred cryptic crossword, until one day it unintentionally offended two powerful wizards from the Order of the Cruciverb.<br><br>To get their revenge, they both cast a spell on the seven worst <b>Across</b> clues in the crossword, one at a time: the first wizard rewrote each of the seven clues in such a way that it ended up containing its answer, thereby violating The Error That Cannot Be Named. The second wizard, disapproving of this error, decided to "fix" it by removing the offending word from each of the seven clues. Surely now no one could solve these clues!<br><br>Of course, like any wizard would, they left evidence behind: every <b>Down</b> clue that crosses one of the affected Across clues has been affected by the magic and has had an additional letter added to the wordplay half of the clue. Reading these additional letters in clue order will reveal a phrase that describes what happened to each of the seven affected clues!<br><br>(All the other Across and Down clues are solved and entered normally.)
